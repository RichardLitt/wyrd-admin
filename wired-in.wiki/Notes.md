Planning notes for October 6th, 2012
_Richard Littauer_

Core idea
---------
 > "A program that learns how the user works, and suggests ways of allocating time better."  

Essential points (Richard):  
 * Non-invasive - we want to make it as easy as possible for the user to keep up with the program and to input and output data.  This also means that the program should only suggest when to do something, and not enforce actioning tasks, nor have inelegant reminders.  
 * Clean User experience - we want to make it minimal, but allow detailed options if the user prefers  
 * Multiple entry points: the user should be able to use this from their computer, from their iPhone, and from the web.  
 * Safe storage: The data has to be stored securely and in an easy-to-access fashion.  
 * Fast: This can't take a long time.   
 * Descriptive: The program should be able to show the user how they work and how it allocates time  
 * Well-documented  

User profiles:  
 * A 17 year old school girl with multiple homework assignments to manage  
 * A high-octane Silicon Valley programmer with multiple projects  
 * An international Masters student with multple projects  
 * A 26 year old work-at-home self-employed person man with one job that he wants to manage better.  
 * A neurotic university student who wants to know exactly how much time he spends brushing his teeth.  
 * A couple who want to share and synchronise their shopping list

Coding issues
-------------

 * What sort of data structure do we want? If object orientated, what classes?  
 * What language to write it in?  Options: C, C++, Java, Python. If not, why not?  
 * What sort of database system do we want?  
 * Licensing: GPL? If we used a private github, this wouldn't be an issue.  
 * Online resources: Django? MongoDB?  

Data to collect
---------------

This, I think, determines the strength of the program or not. We need to collect data enough to be able to implement some sort of learning algorithm, but not so much that the user gets fed up. It may be possible to get some on the way: edits can be gathered non-manually, as can GPS, time-data. Comments can be gathered if they are used along with some sort of diary function.  


Organisational stuff
--------------------

 * Deliverables - on a weekly/biweekly basis, basically by the next skype talk.  
 * Proto-typing before extensive planning - in a sense, we already have a protoype. So, it shouldn't be too hard to extend it now, and rewrite it. What would be good is if we all tried to use it, and see what we didn't like.  
 * Giulia - what do you think you can help on?  

Talk about online resources
---------------------------
 * Github - is everycone comfortable with it? Should we move to a new repo?  
 * The Website - does everyone understand what I want to use it for? Is everyone on board with using it in that way?  
 * Twitter - does anyone want access?  
* Google Groups - There seems to be some confusion with the emails.  
 * Gantt - do we want to use this? This goes over into organisation and roles.  
 * IdeaOtter slates?
